# WordCamp Status Highlighter

A Tampermonkey userscript that highlights WordCamp Central event rows with clear side borders and helpful badges.  
Makes it easier to scan upcoming, urgent, scheduled, and closed events at a glance. ✨

## Features

- **Scheduled (green):** Any event with `status-wcpt-scheduled`  
  - Shows a ⏳ **green badge** if the start date is within 6 weeks.  
- **Active (yellow):** Events not scheduled/closed and with a start date more than 6 weeks away.  
- **Urgent (red):** Events not scheduled/closed and with either no date or a start date within 6 weeks.  
  - Shows a ⏳ **red badge** if a start date is set within 6 weeks.  
  - Shows a ❓ **red badge** if no start date is set.  
- **Closed/Cancelled/Declined (dark gray):** Any event with one of those statuses.
