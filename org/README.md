# WordCamp Status Highlighter

A Tampermonkey userscript that highlights WordPress community event tracker and report tables with color-coded side stripes and optional filters.  
Makes it easier to scan event progress at a glance — now with *racing stripes* for upcoming events. 🏁  

## Features

- **Color-coded borders:** Each event row gets a left stripe based on its status  
  - **Setup (yellow):** Needs vetting, orientation, or setup tasks  
  - **Planning (blue):** Organizers are actively preparing  
  - **Finalizing (purple):** Budget, contracts, or schedule approval in progress  
  - **Scheduled (green):** Everything ready to go  
  - **Completed (dark gray):** The event is done and closed  
  - **Cancelled/Declined (light gray):** Events that won’t take place  
- **Racing stripes:** Events starting within three weeks show a white-accented stripe (⚡️ subtle, not scary).  
- **Filter panel:** Quickly toggle visibility for each status, or check “Starting Soon Only” to see just upcoming events.  
- **Works across pages:** Automatically adapts to both the **Tracker** and **Reports** tables on WordCamp Central.
