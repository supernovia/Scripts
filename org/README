# WordCamp Status Highlighter

A Tampermonkey userscript that highlights WordPress community event tracker rows with clear side borders and helpful badges.  
Makes it easier to scan upcoming, urgent, scheduled, and closed events at a glance. ✨

## Features

- **Scheduled (green):** Any event with `status-wcpt-scheduled`  
  - Shows a **green badge** with a count down if the event starts within six weeks.
- **Active (yellow):** Active events that aren't scheduled yet, but are more than six weeks away.  
- **Urgent (red):** Active events that are not scheduled and either start within six weeks, or are not scheduled.
  - Shows a  **red badge** with a count down if a start date is set within six weeks.  
  - Shows a  **red badge** if no start date is set.  
- **Closed/Cancelled/Declined (dark gray):** Any event with one of those statuses.
